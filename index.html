        <p>DJ Bran grew up in the First State of Delaware. At the young age of 10 is when he discovered his life’s calling in music.<br> By following the example set by his father, a local jockey, DJ Bran had the foundation to propel his career forward in music. <br> Once Bran got started, his momentum continually increased as he created a concrete local following which evolved as he moved <br> crowds from coast to coast. After entertaining crowds of all ages and demographics, Bran was considered a prodigy and a leader <br> amongst his peers, where he was later dubbed “The Youngest in Charge”.</h3>
